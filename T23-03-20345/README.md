## Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **Responsive Layout:** Ensuring the site looked good on both desktop and mobile required careful use of media queries and flexible grid layouts.
- **Form Validation:** Writing regex for validating email and phone inputs was tricky but ensured user inputs are properly checked before submission.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Coordinating CSS variables with JavaScript toggling to maintain theme state was a bit challenging but improved user experience.
- **Embedding Media:** Ensuring correct embed URLs and iframe attributes helped avoid security and display issues with external content.
